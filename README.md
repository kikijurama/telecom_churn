Predicting customer churn for a telecom operator

Predicting customer churn
A telecom operator offering telephony and Internet services wants to know in advance which of the existing customers could potentially refuse services. With this information, it is possible, for example, if the user plans to leave, offer him special conditions in an attempt to retain the client.

The goal of the project is to develop a model for predicting customer churn. For this, personal data about some customers, as well as information about their tariffs and contracts are provided.
